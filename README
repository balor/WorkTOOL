While riding a train and got nothing to do (no internet) i wrote up this simple python script to help myself work@home and maybe other people working like me. Program runs where python runs, and is designed to be minimal (not some big, graphical PIM software with DB etc.).

I often work in home and get cash for every hour i work. I was writing to file how many hours I was working on each day, and after the end of the month, I summerized it and count how much cash I need to beg out from company. That tool try to ease this process a bit do you DRY.

For now just readonly app, need to edit hour log file from hand.

Features:
    - parsing hour log file
    - listing months
    - listing hours in months with searcher
    - summarizing months with searcher

Todo:
    - timer with to-hour converter and pause/stop/resume controls
    - option to add record to month
    - option to delete record from month
    - option to edit record from month
